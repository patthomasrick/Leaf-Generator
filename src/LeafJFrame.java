/**
 * Original project proposal:
 * 
 * The program would be a generator for life-like tree leaf images. The leaves would have variance within 
 * species, and would have the feature of a branching vein generation system. The leaves would be 
 * generated in similar structures as real-life leaves. The structures would for example include veins 
 * extending from one point on the leaf, veins branching from one midrib along the length of the leaf, 
 * and more. While veins are key features of leaves, this is put in place mainly to allow for the easier 
 * creation of the actual leaf. The veins would determine the path of the margin of the leaf, enclosing 
 * the middle of the leaf. The margins would also be customizable, with the margins able to be specified 
 * as a given pattern (smooth, finely-toothed, saw-toothed, etc.). 
 * 
 * This program would have applications mainly limited to research. The main inspiration for this program 
 * is my science fair project, where it was eventually shown that I needed a high quantity of leaf images 
 * to improve the accuracy of the leaf-identification program. This program would allow me to program in 
 * species of leaves and then batch-create hundreds, perhaps even thousands of leaf images. Other research 
 * projects that involve computer vision could also perhaps benefit from this project. Additionally, the 
 * program’s methods could perhaps be useful to graphic designers who need random leaves for their project.
 * For example, the leaves could be used in a game to make trees look life-like.
