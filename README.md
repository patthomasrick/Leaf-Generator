<h1>Leaf Generator</h1>
<h2>A random, life-like leaf generator</h2>
<h3>Original Project Proposal:</h3>
<p>
The program would be a generator for life-like tree leaf images. The leaves would have variance within species, and would have the feature of a branching vein generation system. The leaves would be generated in similar structures as real-life leaves. The structures would for example include veins extending from one point on the leaf, veins branching from one midrib along the length of the leaf, and more. While veins are key features of leaves, this is put in place mainly to allow for the easier creation of the actual leaf. The veins would determine the path of the margin of the leaf, enclosing the middle of the leaf. The margins would also be customizable, with the margins able to be specified as a given pattern (smooth, finely-toothed, saw-toothed, etc.). <br>

This program would have applications mainly limited to research. The main inspiration for this program is my science fair project, where it was eventually shown that I needed a high quantity of leaf images to improve the accuracy of the leaf-identification program. This program would allow me to program in species of leaves and then batch-create hundreds, perhaps even thousands of leaf images. Other research projects that involve computer vision could also perhaps benefit from this project. Additionally, the program’s methods could perhaps be useful to graphic designers who need random leaves for their project. For example, the leaves could be used in a game to make trees look life-like.
